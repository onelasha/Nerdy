NERDY - DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING CASE STUDY
Time: Max 3 hours

THE CHALLENGE:
Build an AI-powered dashboard that identifies at-risk students in Varsity Tutors and recommends interventions.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Student list with risk indicators (high/medium/low)
- AI-generated explanations of WHY each student is at-risk
- AI-generated action recommendations per student
- At least one data visualization (engagement trends, etc.)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Must use an LLM (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, etc) for risk explanations and recommendations
- Deploy to public URL (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- Load time <3 seconds
- Tech stack: Your choice (React, Vue, Python, Node.js, etc.)
- AI coding tools: Use any (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Windsurf, etc)

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Deployed dashboard URL (public link)
2. GitHub repository
3. 3-5 min demo video link (Loom/YouTube/etc)
4. AI development evidence:
   - Development log with prompts & timestamps
   - Git history with AI attribution

REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION (README):
1. Setup - How to run locally
2. AI Development Process ⭐ - Which tools, % AI-generated, effective prompts, time breakdown
3. Risk Logic - How you define "at-risk" and why
4. AI Implementation - How you're using LLM for insights
5. Production Considerations - Scalability, cost, security
6. Trade-offs - What you cut, what you'd add next

EVALUATION (35-min live interview if selected):
- 10 min: Demo walkthrough
- 15 min: AI usage deep dive
- 10 min: Production discussion

SCORING:
- AI-Native Development (40%) - Tool proficiency, prompts, iteration
- Technical Execution (30%) - Features work, clean code, deployed
- Problem-Solving (15%) - Risk logic, scalability, security, trade-offs
- Documentation (15%) - Clear README, AI evidence

DATA GENERATION:
The document includes a Python script to generate sample tutoring data:
- 75 students
- 12 weeks of sessions
- ~1500 sessions total
- Student archetypes: thriving, stable, declining, struggling
- Output: tutoring_data.csv

AI RECOMMENDATION EXAMPLES (VT-Specific):
Tutoring Adjustments:
- Increase session frequency from 1x to 2x per week
- Schedule back-to-back sessions to maintain momentum
- Switch from 30-minute to 60-minute session format
- Match with different tutor who specializes in [subject]
- Add second subject (struggling in multiple areas)

Scheduling & Availability:
- Move sessions to earlier time slot (better engagement pattern)
- Book consistent weekly schedule (currently irregular)
- Add weekend session to catch up on missed material

Parent/Admin Communication:
- Send progress alert to administrator
- Schedule parent conference to discuss attendance pattern
- Share tutor notes and engagement trends with guardian

Academic Support:
- Assign practice problems between sessions
- Provide supplemental learning materials for [topic]
- Focus next 3 sessions on [specific struggling area]
- Review session recordings to identify knowledge gaps

Intervention Escalation:
- Flag for academic intervention team review
- Recommend assessment for additional support needs
- Place on monitoring list for weekly check-ins

TIPS:
- Use AI for: Scaffolding, components, data processing, LLM integration, debugging
- You decide: Architecture, risk logic, UX, prompt engineering
- Ship working is better than perfect - Core features matter most
